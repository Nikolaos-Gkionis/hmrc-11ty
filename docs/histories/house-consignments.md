## A sub-journey

Several methods where explored into making the House consignment sub-journey. Both vertical and horizontal appraches where used. Below is a series of screenshots using the horizontal approach. This sub-journey can end up being a huge amount of pages depending on how many House consignments the user selects, this is set to 999.

## Screenshots

- A radio button option that gives the user the ability to select fromm the start if the House consignments will be more than one.
